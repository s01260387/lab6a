Include your executive summary here..

People need to have account for their morals and ethics when inventing technology. We are capable of making things that seem out of this world but there are people who take advantage of certain things and use them for evil.


# Ethical and Legal Implications of Information Systems
## Code of Ethics
* Explain the purpose of a "code of ethics" and why the ACM created a code for the computing discipline.

One of the major advantages of creating a code of ethics is that it clarifies the acceptable standards of behavior for a professional group.

* Explain the difference between a code of ethics and AUP (acceptable use policies.) 
A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group.
(AUP) this policy outlines what is allowed and what is not allowed while someone is using the organization’s services.
* Pick a site of your choice and read the AUP.  Select a policy of interest and report your findings (include a link to the site in your report.)

There is a policy about sharing personal information.Wkipedia may share your info for legal reasons, Because You Made It Public, because you gave them permission, to understand and experiments, etc. I thought this was interesting because this goes to just you being able to trust this website to not share your information and coming up with a reason to share it. They have the power to do that, so my advice would be to just be careful about what your signing up for.

## Intellectual Property
* From the chapter follow the link to the WIPO.  What is the purpose and importance of the WIPO? 

WIPO is the global forum for intellectual property (IP) services, policy, information and cooperation. We are a self-funding agency of the United Nations, with 193 member states. It's main purpose is to lead the development of a balanced and effective international IP system that enables innovation and creativity for the benefit of all.

* Using links in the chapter explain how a copyright is obtained and the benefit of registering for a copyright with the US Copyright Office. Explain why it might be important to copyright the svg image you created. 

Copyright is the protection given to songs, computer programs, books, and other creative works; any work that has an “author” can be copyrighted. In the United States, a copyright is obtained by the simple act of creating the original work.

* If the svg image you created became an item that identifies a source of goods or services, explain the role of a trademark in defining the intellectual property. 
 
## Information Collection
* Explain how COPPA, FERPA and HIPPA restrict the collection of information on the Internet. 
HIPAA – Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Gives parents rights to their student's information, and governs how school health services share their data.
COPPA -  Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act. Federal law that prevents collection of online data from persons under 13 years of age.
FERPA - Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act. Prevents disclosure of information on grades or behavior to anyone other than the student or parent.

# URLs and File Paths
* Match the following terms / definitions under the heading and explain how they are related by providing an example of all of the pieces of a URL: 
Terms: scheme, domain, top level domain, default page, parameters, anchor 
Definitions/examples: .edu, no file path provided, result of search, https, www.amazon.com, specific location on a page. 


scheme -  This tells your browser what type of address it is so the browser connects to it correctly.
domain name - is the most prominent part of a web address. 
top level domain - the ".org", or the ".com" part of a URL.
parameters - starts with question mark AKA the "paramter string" then a set of characters at the end.
anchor - tells your browser to scroll to or load a specific part of the page.


* What is your understanding of difference between Absolute and Relative File Paths. What would you use in your website? Why?

absolute paths always include the domain name
I would use absolute file paths because they take you to the exact website you're trying to get them to go.


* Explain the purpose and use of file compression.
Zipped (compressed) files take up less storage space and can be transferred to other computers more quickly than uncompressed files.
